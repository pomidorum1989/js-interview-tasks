# Parking Lot Design

This project implements a parking lot using object-oriented principles in JavaScript. The parking lot supports different types of vehicles and provides various functionalities such as checking remaining spots, total spots, and the status of specific types of spots.

## Features

- **Tell us how many spots are remaining**
- **Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot**
- **Tell us when the parking lot is full**
- **Tell us when the parking lot is empty**
- **Tell us when certain spots are full (e.g., when all motorcycle spots are taken)**
- **Tell us how many spots vans are taking up**

## Assumptions

1. The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars, and vans.
2. The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots, and large spots.
3. A motorcycle can park in any spot.
4. A car can park in a single compact spot or a regular spot.
5. A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots.
